# üèòÔ∏è Immobilienbewertung ‚Äì German Real Estate Evaluation Tool

This project is a **prototype web app** that helps buyers and small-scale investors in Germany evaluate residential real estate listings. The tool is built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend required). It is aimed at making property investment decisions easier and more transparent by providing relevant financial metrics and a friendly user interface‚Äîall in German.

## Features

- **User-friendly web form** for entering key property details
- **Investment metric calculations** (effective purchase price, yield, annual rent, price per square meter, and more)
- **Monthly loan payment calculator** based on user financing details
- **Simple financial summary** with a concise interpretation (in German)
- **Logical grouping of input/output fields** for clarity
- **All labels and UI text in German** (but code comments and documentation in English)
- **Ready for expansion:** easily add more logic, design, or backend as needed

   No build or server needed ‚Äì just open the file directly.

## File Structure

- *(To be added)* `app.js` ‚Äì JavaScript for calculation logic (future)
- *(To be added)* `global.css` ‚Äì CSS for layout and design (future)
